Two Phase Locking:

  - Central Data Structure:
    - Lock Table:
      -  Data item
      -  Lock mode
      -  Holding transactions
      -  Waiting queue

  - Lock Acquisiton Algorithim
     - Request lock from lock manager
     - If compatible: grant immediately
     - If incompatible: block transaction
     - Resume when lock becomes available

  - Transaction Blocked Operation Queue 
    - Maps the transactions to the operations that have been skipped due to blocking.
    - When the transaction acquires a lock we run as many of these operations as possible.
